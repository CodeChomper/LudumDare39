The **zombies** became a problem about the same time the world was going through a major power shortageâ€¦.  The only logical solution was to run the world on zombie guts.

You play as a city power collector. It is a highly dangerous job but at least it is lucrative $$$.  You must collect zombie guts and take them back to the power plant before you **RUN OUT OF POWER**.
